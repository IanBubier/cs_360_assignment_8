This is a rudimentary data storage microservice supporting standard CRUD functionality.

The program will accept requests via JSON files sent through the assigned ZeroMQ pipe. The file must load a dictionary with three keys: 'account', 'operation', and 'data'. 'account' must be a string. 'operation' must be the strings 'create', 'read', 'update', or 'delete'. The program will perform the requested operation on the requested account. For 'create' operations, 'data' must be a dictionary of the information to be stored. For 'read' operations, 'data' may be a list of keys for which to retrieve data or None to retrieve all data. For 'update' operations, 'data' must be a dictionary of the information to update or store. For 'delete' operations, 'data' may be a list of keys to delete or None to delete the entire account. The exception to the three-key dictionary format is a JSON file containing the string 'quit', which will end the program.

The program will reply to requests via JSON files sent through the assigned ZeroMQ pipe. For 'create', 'read', or 'delete' operations, the reply will be a string containing a confirmation of success, a string containing the name of a likely error, or nothing if some other error occurred. For 'update' operations, the reply will be a dictionary containing the requested information, a string containing the name of a likely error, or nothing if some other error occurred.
